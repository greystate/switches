# Switches, with Backbone.js

This project was built to accompany a presentation on [Backbone.js][BACKBONE] at [AarhusJS.com][AARHUSJS] - each step of the presentation has its own branch with code branched from the previous.

I use CoffeeScript and LESS with plain old HTML.

The final code ends up using Backbone.js, Underscore.js (BBâ€™s only hard dependency), Zepto.js and backbone.localStorage.js 

The intended sequence of events goes like this:

1. prototype
2. caffeinate
3. modeling
4. viewing
5. evening
6. collecting
7. decouleur
8. storage
